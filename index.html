            <h3>Electrical Engineer & Computer Scientist</h3>
            <p>I graduated from North South University in December 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and
                Computer Engineering. My major was Electrical and Electronic Engineering. My minor was computer
                science. I
                want to use the combination of my knowledge of electrical engineering and computer science in the future
                to
                create something new and make their lives easier and more modern by reaching out to the public.</p>

                    I am the master of HTML,CSS and Javascript. I know
                    everything needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond
                    with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even know the deployment, server and
                    security. I will give you

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Viddsee.</p>
